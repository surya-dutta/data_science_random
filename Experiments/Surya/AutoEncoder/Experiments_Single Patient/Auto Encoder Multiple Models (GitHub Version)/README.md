# Balanced : Same number of layers in Encoder and Decoder
# HeacyDecoder : Decoder has more number of layers than Encoder
# SingleEncoder: Single dense layer for Encoder

# Refer to "1 <Type> - All.ipynb" notebook to see models trained and their results.

# Models are split by the BottleNeck Layer (B) as running them together would crash GPU

# I ran the models without external call to https://gretel.ai/ for report generation due to API limitations.
